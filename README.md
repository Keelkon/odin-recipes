Odin Project - Recipes Project 1

This is the first project in my study through The Odin Project. 

At the end of this project I will have: 
    - Setup a new repository through Github and Git 
    - Practiced using the command line, common git commands, commits and commit messages through a project making process
    - Set up a project directory with accompanying file structure for the project including things like:
        - index.html (main file) with links to accompanying recipe pages
        - directories for new recipe pages 
        - directory for recipe images
    - Created a recipe website using HTML utilizing various HTML elements like headings, paragraphs, images, image captions, lists. 
    - Published project to Github to view on the web.
