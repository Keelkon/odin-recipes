Odin Project - Recipes Project 1

This is the first project in my study through The Odin Project. 

At the end of this project I will have: 
    - Setup a new repository through Github and Git 
    - Practiced using the command line, common git commands, commits and commit messages through a project making process
    - Set up a project directory with accompanying file structure for the project including things like:
        - index.html (main file) with links to accompanying recipe pages
        - directories for new recipe pages 
    - Created a recipe website using HTML utilizing various HTML elements like headings, paragraphs, images, image captions, lists. 
    - Published project to Github to view on the web.



Post-project Reflection:
    This project was great to instill some of the basic html elements for building a webpage. Before this project I was very uncomfortable and unfamiliar when working in the terminal and using Git. Now, after the projectm I feel much better in those two areas which is a big confidence boost. 
    
    I worked on trying to build good Git habits, adding each new page and update to the index.html file into the staging area, then committing them with succinct commit messages. This was great practice getting more comfortable in the terminal with Git but also with basic commands for building a directory and the accompanying structure of files and directories. I also was able to build my comfortability navigating through directories and creating files within the terminal. I love to cook so this project was pretty enjoyable as I was able to really have some fun with the content even though the project itself is very simple. 

    Feeling more comfortable and looking forward to moving on through the curriculum!
