    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pesto Genovese is a delicious basil based sauce with the saltiness of parmigianno regianno, savory bite of garlic, and the slight citrus tang from lemon. It is so good it will have you wanting to try it on everything; pastas, salad dressings, sandwiches, and even pizzas!</p>

    <h3 class="items">Ingredients</h3>
        <ul class="itemlist">
            <li>1 cup Basil</li>
            <li>3 cloves Garlic</li>
            <li>1/3 cup Parmigianno Regianno</li>
            <li>1/4 cup toasted Pine Nuts</li>
            <li>1/3-1/2 cup Olive Oil</li>
            <li>1/2 Lemon zest and juice</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
        </ul>

    <h3 class="steps">Steps <em>(Note: we typically use a food processor but it is traditionally made with a mortar and pestle which works just as well, if not better!)</em></h3>
        <ol class="itemlist">
            <li>Add garlic, nuts, and Parmigianno to food processor and break down slightly to give it a head start ahead of the basil </li>
            <li>Add Basil and Lemon zest and blitz slightly again</li>
            <li>Slowly and gently stream in olive oil as you blitz the ingredients.</li>
                <p>Note: Depending on what you're planning to do with the sauce depends on how slowly you want to add the oil and how much you want to process the sauce. It's all personal prefrence but for pasta we typically go a bit smoother and for things like pizza sauce we leave it a bit chunkier to add textural contrast.</p>
            <li>Finally, add juice and mix with spatula. Taste for seasoning and add pepper and enough salt to brighten the flavors but not taste salty.</li>
        </ol>
