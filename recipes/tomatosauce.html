    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This everyday tomato sauce is a delicious tomato based sauce with the savory sweetness of cooked down whole tomatos, garlic, olive oil and basil. So quick and easy it's perfect for a weeknight meal. It also is a perfect base for any, and as many, additions that you want! </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 can (36 oz) Whole San Marzano Tomatoes</li>
            <li>3 cloves Garlic, crushed</li>
            <li>10-12 leaves of Basil</li>
            <li>3 tbsp Olive Oil (no need to be precise here just give it a heart and healthy glug.) (;/li>
            <li>Parm cheese rind - only if you have it on hand, but next time you finish your bit of Parm remember to keep it as it adds a great flavor to sauces.</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <p><em>(note: the pot or pan you use doesn't really matter but as a very broad rule of thumb, heavy bottom is best, enamled cast iron is better, but use what you have. The two options mention produce a more even distribution of heat.)</em></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat pan to a medium heat, as it is heating add Olive Oil, crushed Garlic cloves and 6 Basil leaves to cold oil to infuse oil as it heats up. If/when it starts to sizzle too much carefully with slotted spoon remove Basil leaves and discard. Be careful not to let garlic burn either.</li>
            <li>Pour Olive Oil in pot, once it looks like it is glistening gently and carefully pour in can of Tomatoes.</li>
            <li>Take back of wooden spoon or slotted spoon and crush the whole tomatoes as much as possible. (If you want or need a smoother sauce at the end of the process use an immersion blender to your hearts desire).</li>
            <li>Stir to combine and fill 1/3 of the can of tomatoes with water and add to pot. Stir again to combine. </li>
            <li>Add remaining Basil leaves and bring sauce to a slight simmer and let reduce. Once sauce coats the back of a spoon and you can run a finger through it and it doesn't run at all, then the sauce is ready. Add Salt and Pepper to taste.</li>
                <p><em><strong>Note:</strong> be careful here, make sure not to over season depending on what you're cooking with the sauce. If just simply adding to some pasta then season to your liking. If using for chicken parm make sure to lightly season as your other ingredients will have their own salt content and you dont want an overly salted mess.</em></p>
            <li class="tip">Pro Tip: depending on what you are using the sauce for you can easily save the leftover sauce and put it in ice cube trays and freeze into easier than ever pasta sauce cubes for a even quicker meal. Or another option is to just put in a jar and keep in fridge for up to 1-2 weeks.</li>
